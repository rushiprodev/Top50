# 📘 LeetCode SQL Problem 1729 - Find Followers Count

## 📝 Problem Statement

The `Followers` table contains the `user_id` and `follower_id` of users in a social media app. Each row indicates that the `follower_id` follows the `user_id`.

Write an SQL query to **return the number of followers for each user**.

Return the result table **ordered by `user_id` in ascending order**.

## 📊 Table: Followers

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| user_id     | int  |
| follower_id | int  |

- (user_id, follower_id) is the primary key.
- Each row means `follower_id` follows `user_id`.

## 💡 Example

**Input:**

`Followers` table:

| user_id | follower_id |
|---------|-------------|
| 0       | 1           |
| 1       | 0           |
| 2       | 0           |
| 2       | 1           |

**Output:**

| user_id | followers_count |
|---------|-----------------|
| 0       | 1               |
| 1       | 1               |
| 2       | 2               |

**Explanation:**
- User 0 is followed by {1} → 1 follower
- User 1 is followed by {0} → 1 follower
- User 2 is followed by {0, 1} → 2 followers

---

## 🧠 Approach

- Count how many times each `user_id` appears in the `Followers` table.
- This gives the number of followers for each user.
- Use `GROUP BY` to group by `user_id`.
- Use `COUNT(*)` to get the number of rows (i.e., followers) per user.
- Use `ORDER BY` to return the result in ascending order by `user_id`.

## ✅ SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    user_id, 
    COUNT(*) AS followers_count
FROM 
    Followers
GROUP BY 
    user_id
ORDER BY 
    user_id;
