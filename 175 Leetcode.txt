ðŸ§© 175 â€“ Combine Two Tables

ðŸ“„ Problem:
You are given two tables:

Person(personId, lastName, firstName)

Address(addressId, personId, city, state)

Return each person's firstName, lastName, city, and state.
If a person has no address, return NULL for city and state.

âœ… Approach:
Use a LEFT JOIN to get all persons, even if they donâ€™t have an address.

ðŸ’» SQL Query:

SELECT 
    p.firstName, 
    p.lastName, 
    a.city, 
    a.state
FROM 
    Person p
LEFT JOIN 
    Address a 
ON 
    p.personId = a.personId;


ðŸ§  Why LEFT JOIN?
Returns all people from Person

If no match in Address, shows NULL for city and state


| firstName | lastName | city          | state    |
| --------- | -------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Allen     | Wang     | NULL          | NULL     |
| Bob       | Alice    | New York City | New York |
