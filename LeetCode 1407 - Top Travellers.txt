# LeetCode 1407 - Top Travellers

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

You are given two tables: `Users` and `Rides`.

- The `Users` table contains:
  - `id`: unique identifier of each user
  - `name`: name of the user

- The `Rides` table contains:
  - `id`: unique identifier of each ride
  - `user_id`: the user who made the ride
  - `distance`: distance travelled in that ride

### ðŸ§¾ Goal:

Report the **total distance travelled by each user**.  
Include users even if they didn't take any rides (`distance = 0` for them).

### ðŸ“Š Return Format:

| name     | travelled_distance |
|----------|--------------------|
| Elvis    | 450                |
| Lee      | 450                |
| Bob      | 317                |
| Jonathan | 312                |
| Alex     | 222                |
| Alice    | 120                |
| Donald   | 0                  |

### ðŸ“Œ Order By:
1. `travelled_distance` in **descending** order
2. `name` in **ascending** order if distances are equal

## âœ… SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    u.name, 
    IFNULL(SUM(r.distance), 0) AS travelled_distance
FROM 
    Users u
LEFT JOIN 
    Rides r ON u.id = r.user_id
GROUP BY 
    u.id, u.name
ORDER BY 
    travelled_distance DESC, 
    u.name ASC;
