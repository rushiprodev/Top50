# LeetCode 181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers

## 🧩 Problem Description

Table: **Employee**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
| managerId   | int     |

- `id` is the **primary key** for this table.
- Each row in the table represents one employee's ID, name, salary, and their manager's ID (`managerId`).
- `managerId` is a reference to the `id` of another employee.
- A `managerId` can be `NULL` if the employee has no manager.

## 🧪 Example

### Input:

**Employee table:**

| id | name  | salary | managerId |
|----|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |

### Output:

| Employee |
|----------|
| Joe      |

### Explanation:

- Joe earns `70000`, and his manager (Sam) earns `60000` → ✅ Joe is included.
- Henry earns `80000`, and his manager (Max) earns `90000` → ❌ Not included.
- Sam and Max have no managers (`NULL`) → skipped.
