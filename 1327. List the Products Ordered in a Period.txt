## 🧾 Problem Description

You are given two tables:

### Products Table

| Column Name      | Type    |
|------------------|---------|
| product_id       | int     |
| product_name     | varchar |
| product_category | varchar |

- `product_id` is the **primary key**.
- This table contains data about the company's products.

### Orders Table

| Column Name   | Type |
|---------------|------|
| product_id    | int  |
| order_date    | date |
| unit          | int  |

- `product_id` is a **foreign key** referencing `Products.product_id`.
- `unit` is the number of products ordered on `order_date`.

### ❓ Goal

Write a SQL query to:
- Return product names that had **at least 100 units ordered** during **February 2020**.
- Include the product name and the total units ordered in that month.
