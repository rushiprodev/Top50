# 196. Delete Duplicate Emails

## ğŸ“„ Problem Statement
The `Person` table contains email addresses, and some of them are duplicates.  
We need to **delete all duplicate emails**, keeping only **one record** (the one with the smallest `id`) for each email.

### Table: `Person`
| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |

- `id` is the **primary key**.
- Emails will not contain uppercase letters.
- The result order **does not matter**.
- We must **write a `DELETE` statement**, not a `SELECT` query.

## ğŸ“Œ Example

### Input:
| id  | email            |
|-----|------------------|
| 1   | john@example.com |
| 2   | bob@example.com  |
| 3   | john@example.com |

### Output:
| id  | email            |
|-----|------------------|
| 1   | john@example.com |
| 2   | bob@example.com  |

**Explanation:**  
`john@example.com` appears twice. We keep the row with the **smallest id** (`id = 1`) and delete the others.

---

## ğŸ’¡ Approach
We compare each row (`p1`) with other rows (`p2`) having the **same email** and delete the row where `p1.id > p2.id`.  
This ensures that only the row with the **smallest id** for each email remains.

---

## âœ… MySQL Solution
```sql
DELETE p1
FROM Person p1
JOIN Person p2
  ON p1.email = p2.email
WHERE p1.id > p2.id;
