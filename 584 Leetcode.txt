**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topic:** SQL  
**Database:** MySQL / PostgreSQL compatible  

---

### üß© Problem Description

Given a table `Customer` with the following schema:

| Column Name | Type    | Description                            |
|-------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| id          | int     | Primary key of the customer            |
| name        | varchar | Name of the customer                   |
| referee_id  | int     | ID of the customer who referred them (nullable) |

You are asked to find the **names of customers** who are:
- either **not referred by anyone** (`referee_id IS NULL`)
- or **referred by a customer whose `id` is not 2**

---

### üîç Example

#### Input

**Customer table:**

| id | name | referee_id |
|----|------|------------|
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |

#### Output

| name  |
|--------|
| Will  |
| Jane  |
| Bill  |
| Zack  |

---

### üí° Approach

To solve this, we use a `WHERE` clause with an `OR` condition:

1. `referee_id IS NULL` ‚Üí selects customers with no referrer.
2. `referee_id != 2` ‚Üí selects customers referred by someone other than customer `id = 2`.

---

### ‚úÖ SQL Query

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;


## ‚ùì Why Use `IS NULL` Instead of `= NULL`

In SQL, `NULL` means **"unknown" or "missing value"**, not an actual value.

- `= NULL` ‚Üí ‚ùå Incorrect (always returns false or unknown)
- `IS NULL` ‚Üí ‚úÖ Correct way to check for missing values

### ‚úÖ Example

```sql
-- Correct
WHERE referee_id IS NULL;

-- Wrong
WHERE referee_id = NULL;  -- ‚ùå Doesn't work as expected
