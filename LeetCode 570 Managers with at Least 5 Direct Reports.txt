## ðŸ§¾ Problem Description

You are given a table named `Employee`:

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                          |
|-------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| id          | int     | The unique ID of the employee                        |
| name        | varchar | The name of the employee                             |
| department  | varchar | The department the employee belongs to              |
| managerId   | int     | The ID of their manager (nullable)                   |

- `id` is the **primary key**.
